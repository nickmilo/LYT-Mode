## History of LYT Mode

This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) theme is meant to be the definitive evoltion of my first love: the [Cybetron ](https://github.com/nickmilo/Cybertron) theme.

[@nickmilo](https://github.com/nickmilo) and [@ceciliamay](https://github.com/ceciliamay) crossed paths in an LYT workshop. At the same time, Cecilia was designing the winner of Obsidian's 2021 Theme of the Year with the now legendary theme, [Primary](https://github.com/ceciliamay/obsidianmd-theme-primary). Before the winner was known, Nick reached out to the public for help to take Cybertron to the next level. It was going to take more CSS & Design skill than what he could muster. Luckily, Cecilia raised her hand. Then Nick commissioned Cecilia May to design LYT Mode and this is the result.

## Supported Plugins

LYT Mode focused on emphasizing support for markdown or note-native features, as well as all of Obsidian’s core features and visual cues. That being said, LYT Mode should work with most plugins but this list shows plugins given extra love or design support.
